# Flight Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of commercial flight data, focusing on patterns, delays, and insights derived from the dataset provided by the Harvard Dataverse.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be accessed at the following link:

[https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7/2BHLWK&version=1.0](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7/2BHLWK&version=1.0)

This dataset includes detailed flight information and serves as the foundation for the exploratory data analysis and visualizations conducted in this project.

## Reference Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook (`FlightDataAnalysis.ipynb`) included in this repository provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis, including:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualization of key trends and insights
* Summary of findings and potential extensions

You can use the notebook as a reference to understand the workflow, methodology, and conclusions drawn from the dataset.
